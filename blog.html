            <b>"<i>A new look, A new horizon, A bright future</i>" - August 24, 2025 8:03 PM</b><br>
            <br>
            So the website got a makeover! And I also decided to destroy the old blog
            posts. They no longer reflect, to any degree, the direction of the platform and
            it would be just a big mess to explain them away so, poof!<br>
            <br>
            I'm currently in the process of making the "Clippy says 'ROBLOX is a lost
            cause, let's make our own.'" video. The weight of having to deal with messy
            libraries, solo dev, the weight of not being able to perform fast enough, the
            works has made me come to the decision that simply I will just make a video, a
            call to action. Get people behind the project.<br>
            <br>
            All former code has also been destroyed. We're starting fresh, and we're going
            to make it better than ever before. Cleaner code, stronger code, a more
            professional workflow, it's gonna be great, and it's gonna be greater with
            funding and at least one more dev behind it.<br>
            <br>
            But honestly? It's also a bit anxiety inducing. I really didn't want to have to rely
            on the chance that people may go with the idea, so I could present it to them
            somewhat complete so they may be more willing to commit to it. But, alas.
            That did not happen.<br>
            <br>
            A bit ranty. I'm just a bit uncomfortable, is all. New terrain. But I guess, any
            good leader, or any innovator, or any explorer, successful or unsuccessful has
            something like this ocassionally in their endeavours.<br>
            <br>
            Ciao!
