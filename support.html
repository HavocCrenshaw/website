        <h1>Support Imagik!</h1>
        <p class="Text">
            There are three ways to support the Imagik project!<br>
            <br>
            Firstly, you can SHARE THE WORD. The embedded video at the <a href="index.html">home page</a>
            is a FANTASTIC video to share, but also talking to friends about the project
            and sharing the website link around is encouraged heavily.<br>
            <br>
            Secondly, you can HELP DEVELOPMENT. You can contact us at the <a href="contact.html">contact
            page</a>. We encourage you to use the discord listed, and not the email. Email is
            acceptable, however.<br>
            <br>
            Last, but not least, you can DONATE.
        </p>

            Imagik is a project to go against Roblox and bring back the safety, community,
            and fun.<br>
            <br>
            Imagik aims to recreate a experience similar to 2006 Roblox, modernized for
            today. On top of that, Imagik holds to heart strong values, putting the
            community first.<br>
            <br>
            The Imagik project needs funding, of course. Any money helps, but we aim for
            around $5000 minimum as a strong base to fund servers & hosting, cover
            expenses regarding the development process, and any possible unforeseen
            costs.<br>
            <br>
            We're tired of Roblox's utter disregard for the safety of the community, and
            their constant exploitative and predatory behavior towards children.<br>
            <br>
            We thank you for participating in bringing back community and safety to the
            Internet, and for supporting the development of Roblox's rival platform.
