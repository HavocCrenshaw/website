        <h1>Welcome to Imagik!</h1>
        <p class="Text">
            Imagik is a solution to a problem.<br>
            <br>
            Companies do not want to take responsibility for their own platform. While
            big businesses roll around in their monumentous amounts of money, they actively
            crush the consumer, and participate in borderline illegal and completely
            unethical practices. Case in point, recent decisions Roblox Corporation has
            made, especially around the safety of it's users, particularly children. It's a
            crazy world we live in, but it's not a world we have to live in.<br>
            <br>
            What big businesses do not understand is that they do not function without their
            consumers. Even in a pure capitalist environment, people will give up certain
            luxuries to avoid supporting something they believe is hurting them.
            Fortunately, there is, (to my knowledge), no pure capitalist countries. Anti-monopoly
            laws and laws like it present in most countries actively encourage
            the people to take matters into their own hands.<br>
            <br>
            Hence, Imagik. We won't stand for Roblox's greed. We won't stand for
            Roblox's continuous harassment and violation of user rights. We've had enough of it. It's 
            time to take the power back, for the people to stand for a better digital world.<br>
            <br>
            Imagik's goals are simple. We take Roblox, and we restart. Back to 2006, but
            brought to 2025. We'll make it modern, polished, but it serves as a fantastic
            base for what can become on-par with modern Roblox, but better in every way.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to see this project take off, if you want to make the world a better
            place, if you want to make sure that Imagik can succeed so that Imagik can
            actually do good, to do right where Roblox and other corporations did wrong,
            we encourage you to <a href="support.html">support us.</a><br>
            <br>
            I whole heartedly thank anybody who read this message, and cannot thank
            enough the people who choose to support the Imagik project.
        </p>
